# Code of Conduct

This is an open but relatively small technical project. To keep collaboration pleasant and safe for everyone, please follow these rules.

## 1. Communication

- Be respectful to other contributors.
- Stay on topic: bugs go to issues, changes go to pull requests.
- Critique code and decisions, not people.

## 2. Not Allowed

- Harassment, personal attacks, or discriminatory language.
- Spam or off-topic content.
- Publishing sensitive data such as Home Assistant long-lived tokens, API keys, passwords, or private/local network details.
- Intentionally malicious changes (backdoors, credential harvesting, etc.).

## 3. Security & Privacy

This project may interact with local services and Home Assistant:

- When sharing logs or config in an issue, redact tokens, IP addresses, domains, and passwords.
- If you discover a potential security issue, contact the maintainer privately first before opening a public issue.

## 4. Reporting

If you notice behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

- Open an issue in this repository, **or**
- Contact the repository maintainer via GitHub.

The maintainer reserves the right to hide or remove comments/issues that violate these rules.

## 5. Enforcement

Depending on the severity, the maintainer may:

1. Issue a warning,
2. Edit or remove problematic comments or issues,
3. Close or reject a pull request,
4. In severe or repeated cases, block the user from the repository.

This Code of Conduct may be updated as the project grows.
